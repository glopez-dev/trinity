# Trinity Project - Technical Documentation

Trinity is a comprehensive retail management solution composed of three distinct parts:
- DevOps infrastructure
- Web application with RESTful API
- Mobile application

The project aims to improve customer experience and internal operations for a grocery chain through:
- Enhanced customer purchasing process via an intuitive mobile application
- Optimized product management and sales supervision through a web application
- Streamlined decision-making with key performance indicators visualization

## Documentation Structure

### Agile user-centered Design
- [User Personas](docs/user_personas.md)
- [User Stories](docs/user_stories.md)
- [User Needs Analysis](docs/user_needs.md)
- [User Needs Prioritization Matrix](docs/user_needs_priorization_matrix.md)

```bash
# Run the following command and custom the .env file values
cp .env.example .env
```

You have to define the Docker compose secrets :

```bash
# Copy the .secrets.example directory recursively and define your own values
cp -r .secrets.example .secrets
```
